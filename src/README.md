# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with React

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the React library. The game allows two players to take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```shell
$ cd tic-tac-toe
```

3. Install the dependencies using npm.

```shell
   $ npm install
```

## Usage

To start the Tic-Tac-Toe game, use the following command:

```shell
$ npm start
```

This command will launch the game in your default browser. The game board will be displayed, and the first player (X) will be able to make a move. Players can click on an empty cell to mark it with their symbol. The game will automatically switch turns between X and O. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the source code. The main files to look into are:

`<ul>`
`<li>`
src/components/Board.js: This file contains the logic for rendering the game board and handling player moves.
`</li>`
`<li>`
src/components/Game.js: This file manages the game state and determines the winner.
`</li>`
`</ul>`
Feel free to explore these files and make changes according to your requirements.
